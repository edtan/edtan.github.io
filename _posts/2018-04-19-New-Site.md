I've finally rewrote this site in Rails as a basic blog. I wanted to create
something very simple with no extra CSS or Javascript, and to just have a spot
to quickly jot down ideas and notes. There will be various topics, ranging from
software development and mathematics to music and guitar. This has been on my
to-do list for a while now, so I'm happy it's finally alive!
